# Awesome NZ Data [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of New Zealand data sources, APIs, registers and portals, tagged with what each one is and what it takes to use it.

The list is also published as a searchable site at <https://olitreadwell.github.io/awesome-nz-open-data/>, generated from this README by `scripts/build_site.py`.

## Legend

Every entry is tagged with what it is, what it takes to use, and whether it is still the current tool for that data.

Each tag has its own shape, so the tags can be told apart without relying on colour. On the site the colour marks which axis a tag belongs to: blue for type, green for access, amber for status.

- Type: `⇄ API` (a programmatic interface), `▦ Data` (datasets you download or query), `☰ Portal` (a site you search across many datasets), `☑ Register` (an official register you look records up in), `¶ Docs` (documentation or metadata with no data of its own).
- Access: `○ Open` (no key and no account needed), `◑ Key` (API key or developer registration), `◕ Login` (user account), `● Paid`. The shape fills up as the access gets harder: empty is open, solid is paid.
- Status: `⟳ Legacy` (still online, but superseded) or `▣ Archived` (frozen snapshot). No status tag means current.

Tags sit between the link and the description, in that order:

```
- [Name](https://example.govt.nz/) - ▦ Data - ○ Open - what it holds.
- [Name](https://example.govt.nz/) - ⇄ API - ◑ Key - ⟳ Legacy - what it holds.
```

Dead links are repaired or dropped as they are found, and a weekly job re-checks every link.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Pull requests are very welcome :smile:.

Tags are checked by `scripts/validate_readme.py`, so every entry needs a type (`API`, `Data`, `Portal`, `Register`, `Docs`) and an access level (`Open`, `Key`, `Login`, `Paid`), plus a status (`Legacy`, `Archived`) if the tool has been superseded.

If you spot a dead link, or a link that points at a page instead of the data itself, open an issue or send a PR.
